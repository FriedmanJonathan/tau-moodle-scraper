# tau-moodle-scraper
This code scrapes Tel Aviv University's Moodle software, downloading all PDF, Word and Excel files from the desired courses.
Naturally, you must be a TAU student and have access to your own student page.

The code NO LONGER WORKS AS IS due to changes on TAU's website; I don't plan on updating it as my student access is soon to expire.
The project showcases some basic scraping, including completing the required login process using selenium.
If you're a TAU student looking to save time, I encourage you to draw inspiration from the code here... and then write your own code independently, since that's the best way to learn.
